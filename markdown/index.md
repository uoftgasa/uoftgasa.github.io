## Units
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

The Astronomy and Astrophysics community at UofT is composed of several units: the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Dunlap Institute, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and the Centre for Planetary Sciences. The relationships between these bodies can be a bit complex, but each unit is a part of the overall fabric of the department. Most importantly, a student can work with a professor affiliated with any of the units, and your program will be the same.

### Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
[Website](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca)

All astronomy graduate students at UofT are officially affiliated with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics (DAA), primarily spread across two buildings, the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building) and the 12th, 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower).  The department is responsible for running the graduate program, and paying you in your first year, and offers scholarships abd travel grants. The department is also responsible for offering graduate courses and employing you for TA work.

### Dunlap Institute

[Website](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca)

The Dunlap Institute (Dunlap) is primarily focused on instrumentation and outreach. Dunlap members (professors and post-docs) are located in the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building). Graduate students can become affiliated with the Dunlap if they are supervised by a Dunlap prof. These students can apply for additional funding not available to the rest of their cohort and are invited to Dunlap specific events like holiday parties and the 3 day Dunlap Retreat.

### Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics

[Website](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca)

The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) focuses on theoretical work CITA is located on the 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower), and graduate students working with a CITA prof usually have offices on the 12th, 13th, and 14th floors of that building.

### Centre for Planetary Sciences
[Website](https://cps.utoronto.ca)

The Centre for Planetary Sciences (CPS) is located on UofT's [Scarborough campus](#scarborough). Most offices are on the 5th floor of the Science Wing.

## Graduate Program
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

The graduate program is described in detail on the [department website](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/graduate-studies/current/program/). By default, students entering the program are in the 5-year direct entry PhD or 4-year PhD. The MSc degree is not typically used as a point of entry, but rather awarded to students who exit the direct entry program early having completed some of its requirements. 

### Direct Entry vs Standard PhD

The 'Direct Entry PhD' refers to the 5-year program in which most students are enrolled. Students attending UofT already in possession of a MSc will be entered into the 4-year 'Standard PhD' track. The sections below describe the direct entry PhD, but the requirements for the standard PhD are the same except that standard PhD students are expected to identify their supervisor prior to entering the program, are not required to take any courses, and are expected to complete the qualifying exams in their first year instead of their second.

### AST1501Y and AST1500Y

These two courses are the research component of the first year of the [direct entry](#direct-entry-vs-standard-phd) PhD program. Note that in this first year, students are paid by the department for their research, rather than being paid by an individual supervisor. Students must enrol in AST1501Y on [ACORN](acorn.utoronto.ca) in their first semester of the program, and the course continues until the end of the winter semester (the end of April). Students subsequently enrol in AST1500Y (also through [ACORN](acorn.utoronto.ca)) which takes them through until the end of August. Both courses are similar in both structure and requirements, but AST1500Y has a shorter timeline because students are expected to be more familiar with the department and will no longer have other [courses](#courses) or [teaching](#teaching) obligations. It is expected, but not strictly required, that students will explore two different fields of study in these courses, even if they have a clear idea of the thesis work they would like to pursue. Both courses have class discussion components, which are used to develop research skills like reading scientific papers, presenting research, and asking questions to structure a project. The list below outlines all of the components and requirements of the two courses. Written requirements are submitted to the supervisor and the graduate co-chair.

- **Identify a supervisor**
	- In the fall semester, faculty taking on students will give short presentations outlining potential projects.
	- *Deadline*:
		- AST1501Y: by the end of October
		- AST1500Y: by the second week of May
- **Submit a project proposal**
	- 3-4 pages single column, including an introduction to the field, motivation for why the project is important, description of how the student will tackle the problem, and month-by-month timeline
	- *Deadline*
		- AST1501Y: by the second week of November
		- AST1500Y: by the end of May
- **Submit monthly updates**
	- One paragraph indicating progress and stumbling blocks
	- *Deadline*
		- AST1501Y and AST1500Y: at the end of each month after the project proposal 
- **Submit research report**
	- If the project led to publication (either in prep, submitted or accepted) this may be submitted in lieu of a report.
	- The report should be no more than 10 pages describing the outcome of the project, typically following the Introduction-Methods-Results-and-Discussion (IMRaD) format, although other sections may be necessary prior to Methods (e.g. Data if working with survey data, or Observations if taking observations). Examples of IMRaD in astronomy can be found [here](http://www.raa-journal.org/docs/RAA_Lectures/RAA_Lecture2.pdf).
	- *Deadline* - note this must be submitted a week in advance of the mini-defense
		- AST1501Y: by the end of April
		- AST1500Y: by the end of August
- **Mini-defense**
	- A final presentation of the results of the project to a committee of three: your supervisor, the graduate co-chair and a third faculty or post-doc not directly involved with the project. 
	- The presentation is 10-15 minutes long, with 5 minutes for a follow-up question period. It is called a mini-defense because it's structure emulates the final thesis defense.
	- *Deadline*
		- AST1501Y: by the end of April
		- AST1500Y: by the end of August

Along with these formal requirements, students work with their supervisors to establish specific expectations such as hours worked in the office or one-on-one meeting times and frequency.

## Housing
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

### On-Campus
Graduate students have a few on-campus residence options. Incoming graduate students are not guaranteed on-campus housing the same way undergraduates are, but as most grad students opt for off-campus housing, it is possible to find an on-campus option. 

#### Grad House


#### Massey College


### Off-Campus
Housing in Toronto is pricey, and off-campus options have a range of associated costs. In this section, we'll talk about what you can expect to rent and at what price point, as well as where you might expect to live.

#### Neighbourhoods
Below is a list of neighbourhoods in which graduate students have recently lived off campus.
- Chinatown and Kensington Market
- Bay Street Corridor
- The Annex
- Palmerston and Little Italy
- Trinity Bellwoods and West Queen West
- Harbourfront (Front St to Queen's Quay, Bathurst to Parliament
- Liberty Village and Fort York

## Getting Around
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

While many students opt to live close enough to campus to walk, this can be financially challenging. There are many alternative ways to get around the city.

### Public Transit

There are two primary transit options in downtown Toronto, the TTC and GO transit, which connect to other transit agencies in nearby cities. 

Transit vehicle schedules are available online as well as through a variety of transit apps (e.g. [Transit](https://transitapp.com)).

#### Toronto Transit Commission

This system of subways, streetcars, and buses is the primary public transit option within the city. You can find the full system map [here](https://www.ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/TTC_SystemMap.pdf). 

**Fares:**
Depending on your frequency of use, there are few payment options. For anyone living in the city, the Presto card or the Post-secondary Monthly pass are the best options; the others are more suitable for someone visiting from out of town. Even if you feel you will not use transit often, it is worth investing in a Presto Card (described in a section below).

- **Cash fare: $3.25/trip** 
	- requires a transfer to switch routes, see the Transfers section below for more details
	- best for infrequent users
- **Presto fare: $3.00/trip** (although the card has a startup cost)
	- tap this reloadable card at every route switch, see the Presto Card section below for more details
	- best for frequent users who also use other transit agencies
- **Day Pass: $12.50/day** 
	- unlimited travel for one day
	- make 4 trips to break even with the cash fare
	- make 5 trips to break even with the Presto fare
	- best for infrequent users
- **Weekly Pass: $43.75/week** 
	- unlimited travel for a week
	- make 14 trips to break even with the cash fare
	- make 15 trips to break even with the Presto fare
	- best for infrequent users
- **Post-secondary student Metropass: $116.75/month** 
	- unlimited travel for a month carrying a [post-secondary ID card](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Seniors_students_and_children/Post_Secondary_Students/index.jsp)
	- make 36 trips to break even with the cash fare
	- make 39 trips to break even with the Presto fare
	- best for frequent users who use the TTC every weekday
- **Adult monthly Metropass: $146.25/month** (although you can reduce this to $134.00/month by purchasing  a year's worth with the [Monthly Discount Plan](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Passes/Metropass/Metropass_MDP/index.jsp))
	- unlimited travel for a month
	- make 45 trips to break even with the cash fare
	- make 49 trips to break even with the Presto fare
	- best for frequent users who use the TTC every weekday and do not have a [post-secondary ID card](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Seniors_students_and_children/Post_Secondary_Students/index.jsp)
	- this pass can be purchased as a card of loaded onto a Presto card

Note that as long as you get the [post-secondary ID card](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Seniors_students_and_children/Post_Secondary_Students/index.jsp), there is no benefit to choosing the Adult Metropass over the Post-secondary Metropass. TTC passes are only valid on TTC vehicles, and do not extend to other transit agencies. Discounts when switching to other agencies from the TTC may be possible with a Presto card.

**Transfers/Proof of Payment (PoP):**
After paying a cash fare, be sure to pick up a paper transfer (also referred to as proof of payment), which will allow you to switch routes for free provided you are making a one way trip and board the next available vehicle towards your destination. Full transfer rules are [here](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Transfers/index.jsp). Presto card users must tap their card at each route switch but do not require a paper transfer. Note that some users have reported double charges from this process, it is worth checking your transactions and disputing unfair charges. Pass holders do not require any form of transfer.

The proof of payment for each of the fares discussed above is as follows:

- **Cash fare: paper transfer**
- **Presto fare: Presto card**
- **Day Pass: Day Pass**
- **Weekly Pass: Weekly Pass** 
- **Post-secondary student Metropass: Metropass** 
- **Adult monthly Metropass: Metropass**

Proof of payment is especially important on streetcars, where no one checks that you've paid when you board. Streetcar riders are randomly checked by TTC Fare Inspectors to ensure they've paid their fare. You will get ticketed if you don't have proof, even if you did actually pay but forgot to pick up the transfer. A common point of confusion for this is at Union station, where its possible to disembark from the subway and walk right to the 509/510 streetcars without passing through any fare gates.  If you didn't pick up a transfer in the station where you boarded the subway, you'll be out of luck if your streetcar gets checked later on.

**The Presto Card:**

Local transit agencies are attempting to unify the Presto card, allowing you to have one piece of fare media to use in a variety of different systems. The card costs $6 to buy, and must be preloaded with either $10 (when purchased online or in a participating Shoppers Drug Mart), or $14 (when purchased in a subway station). An online card order will take 2 weeks to deliver by mail, so its worth investigating Presto's [exhaustive list of purchase locations](https://www.prestocard.ca/en/find-an-outlet/customer-service-outlets). Once purchased, the card can be refilled online, in participating Shoppers Drug Marts, or at machines in transit stations.

The card is activated by tapping. On the TTC, this action either deducts the flat $3.00 fares, or algorithmically determines that you are making a valid transfer from another TTC vehicle (see the [TTC's Presto transfer rules](https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/FAQ.jsp)). This algorithm is not perfect; keep an eye on your balance and dispute unfair charges. In other transit agencies, fares may be charged by distance travelled; in these cases it is essential to 'tap on' when you enter a vehicle and 'tap off' when you leave it.

Note that a Presto card **does not** automatically switch to a monthly Metropass when your fares equal the cost of the pass. It is up to you to purchase a monthly Metropass on your card at the beginning of the month if you think you will use it.

Presto card users typically enjoy reduced fares when switching between transit agencies. 

**Rush Hours**

As in any city, there are times of day when more people are trying to get around. At these times, vehicles might be packed to crush depth, making it difficult or impossible to board. Graduate students are lucky to have typically flexible working hours; if you take transit regularly, it's worth investigating the times are which your routes are busiest so you can give yourself the option of a peaceful trip to the office.

#### GO Transit

### Cycling

### Cars

#### Car-share programs

#### Taxis, Uber, and Lyft

### Air Travel

Toronto has two international airports: Pearson International Airport (YYZ) in the north and the much smaller Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) on Lake Ontario.

#### Pearson International Airport
Pearson is a behemoth of an airport, reachable by car or a variety of [public transit options](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/toandfrom/public/#), including the Union Pearson Express, a train with $9 fares for Presto card users (see the [TTC](#toronto-transit-commission) section for more details on the Presto Card).

Pearson has two terminals, helpfully labelled Terminal 1 (for higher-end airlines and Air Canada) and Terminal 3 (typically budget airlines and often domestic destinations). Both terminals are recently renovated, and they are connected by a free monorail. For a full list of which airline flies out of which terminal, you can check [Pearson's website](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/flights/airlines-destinations/#).

This airport has customs pre-clearance for destinations in the US, meaning you do US customs before you board the plane instead of after.

#### Billy Bishop Airport

This airport offers flights to domestic and US destinations, mostly via the budget Porter Airlines. It's conveniently accessible at the foot of Bathurst street, with a free shuttle service between the main terminal and the Line 1 subway Union Station. It's also easily reachable by public transit, either by the 509 Harbourfront or 511 Bathurst streetcar lines.

## UofT Services
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

### TCard
Students at UofT are furnished with a TCard. This card allows you to borrow books from the library, access card-locked areas to which you are entitled (e.g. limited access classrooms, athletic facilities), purchase food if you choose a meal plan in residence, and access the on campus health services. You'll need the card to gain access to UofT's online administrative tools like [Portal](#portal) and [ACORN](#acorn). The card also gives you access to student discounts at a variety of cultural and retail locations (see the [Saving Money as a Student](#saving-money-as-a-student) section).

### School of Graduate Studies
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

The School of Graduate Studies (SGS) sends out frequent emails with the many workshops and events they run for graduate students, which are primarily located in [Grad Room](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Grad-Room.aspx) at the base of Grad House on the corner of Harbord Street and Spadina Ave. These events range from career focused workshops to subsidized trips.

The SGS also maintains the [Graduate Centre for Academic Communication](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/GCAC.aspx), which runs workshops and courses on academic communication as well as one-on-one writing consultations. This is an excellent service; with enough advance notice they will help you edit your writing to make it truly excellent.

In addition, the SGS offers many courses to help you enhance skills that may not be explicitly taught elsewhere. These courses are offered under the umbrella of the [Graduate Professional Skills Program](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Professional-Development.aspx)  (GPS), and categorized into Communication, Personal Effectiveness, Teaching Competency and Research-Related Skills. Completing enough courses will earn you a GPS notation on your transcript. Highlights for astronomy students include

- Oral Presentation Skills (for Native and Non-Native Speakers of English)
- Understanding the Research Article: Reading Towards Writing
- Let's Talk Science: Introduction to Science Outreach
- Writing NSERC Proposals
- Time Management
- Prewriting Strategies for Developing and Organizing Your Ideas
- Teaching Fundamental Certificate and the Advanced University Teaching Preparation Certificate (see the [TATP](#teaching-assistant-training-program) section for more information on these)
- Effective Journal Research for Graduate Students and Faculty
- Introduction to Data and Information Visualization
- Introduction to Research Management
- Online Tools for Organizing your Research

Sadly there are no links to these courses, as they are offered only sporadically. Checking the GPS link above will reveal the scheduled programming for the upcoming academic year.

### [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca)

As they say, having fun isn't hard if you have a library card. The [UofT Library](#uoft-library) can certainly meet your academic needs, but the TPL has more on offer than astronomy text books. Getting a TPL card requires proof that you live at a Toronto address (addressed mail to where you live will do), and once you have one it's good for a year. The card gives you access to the TPL's enormous catalogue, including their collection of ebooks,  digital newspapers, and audiobooks. But in addition to this traditional library offerings, the TPL offers access to 'digital innovation hubs', where you can use 3D printers, digital design workstations and recording studios. They also have a partnership with the Toronto Tool Library for all of your tinkering needs. The TPL also offers plenty of programming to give you a chance to pick up a new skill or hone an old one, so there's no reason not to get a card. However, if all of this blatant fawning hasn't convinced you to get a card, you can still work in any of the 100 branches. I can certainly attest to the fact that the atmosphere in the Toronto Reference Library at Yonge and Bloor is much more positive than that in [Robarts](#robarts). The nearest Toronto Public Library locations are 

- [Lillian H Smith - 239 College St](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/lillianhsmith/)
- [Toronto Reference Library - 789 Yonge St](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/torontoreferencelibrary/)
- [Spadina Road - 10 Spadina Road](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/spadina/)

## Things to do in Toronto
[**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

### [The Royal Ontario Museum](https://www.rom.on.ca/en)
Canada's largest museum is a marvel inside and out - the interesting architechtural choices made for this building are best experienced in person. The special exhibitions bring extra variety to the usual displays on the museum's four floors. The geology exhibit is a close favourite of mine, but locals will have fond memories of the bat cave, and the new dinosaur exhibit can't help but impress. If you want to take a look, visit on a Tuesday with your student card for free entry. The museum is easily accessible from the Line 1 subway Museum Station, or by a 10 minute walk from the DAA.

### [The Art Gallery of Ontario](https://ago.ca)

This art gallery is another architechtural marvel, and is embedded in a neighbourhood of other smaller galleries and art stores. Arrive after 6pm on a Wednesday for free admission (no student id required!). The AGO curates a huge selection of classical and modern art in its light filled space, although my personal highlight is the collection of model ships in the basement. The AGO is easily reachable by the 505 Dundas streetcar line or by walking from St Patrick Station on the Line 1 subway. It's also only a 10 minute walk from the DAA.

### [The Don Valley Park](https://donrivervalleypark.ca/park-map/)
If big city living has you hungry for greenery, look no farther than the Don River Valley Park. While Don Valley in casual conversation almost exclusively refers to the major highway that runs along the valley, the park is surprisingly tranquil. There is an extensive trail system suitable for walking or cycling, and at the right time of year you can visit the river to see the salmon run. At the south end of the park you can visit [Riverdale Farm](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/zoos-farms/riverdalefarm/), a working farm hosting beautiful gardens, historic buildings, and a pig and poultry barn. In the north you can find the [Evergreen Brick Works](https://www.evergreen.ca/evergreen-brick-works/), a former brick making factory that now hosts a variety of events to encourage sustainability, including regular markets, swap meets and art exhibitions. The Evergreen Brick Works runs a shuttle from the Line 2 subway Broadway Station, but one can also walk down into the valley from the Line 2 subway Castle Frank Station.


### [The PATH](http://torontopath.com/path-map/)

The ultimate test of your navigational abilities, the PATH will take only the hardiest souls to their intended destinations. Much of Toronto's business district is connected by underground tunnels filled with shops, food courts, and desperately turned around tourists. Hop off the Line 1 subway at any station south of Queen St and follow the signs for the PATH to start exploring.

### [The Eaton Centre](https://www.cfshops.com/toronto-eaton-centre.html)

Sitting between the Times Square wannabe of Yonge and Dundas Square to the North and Nathan Phillips Square to the South, this mall is equipped to help you shop until well after your standard dropping point with four floors of retail, and two food courts. If you feel the need to step outside, there are good odds that either of the bounding squares are hosting an event; if nothing else the strange alien spaceship of Toronto's new City Hall is worth a look. Nearer to the mall you can also find the [Toronto Public Labyrinth](http://www.labyrinthnetwork.ca/toronto-public-labyrinth/). You can easily reach the mall by taking the Line 1 subway to Queen or Dundas stations.

### [Roundhouse Park and CN Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/3oZbcarwnRr)

If you've seen one Toronto sizzle reel, this area was probably heavily featured. Surrounded by glass walled condos, the Roundhouse Park is easy walking distance from the [SkyDome](https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/tickets) (now often known by the inferior moniker *The Rogers Centre*), the [Air Canada Centre](https://www.aircanadacentre.com) (go Raptors!),  [Ripley's Aquarium](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com), [Steamwhistle Breweries](https://steamwhistle.ca), and of course, the [CN Tower](http://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/home.html) (it's 553 m tall, if you read the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)). This area is a short walk from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or from the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [The Harbourfront Centre](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com)

Just steps to the south of the Roundhouse park awaits a smorgasbord of free artistic offerings spread along Toronto's waterfront. Two free art galleries, a winter skating rink and summer artisan markets make this area worth a visit at any time of the year. It's easily reachable by foot from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or more directly by the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [Toronto Islands](http://www.torontoisland.com)

The islands are a surprising escape from the city only a 15 minute ferry ride away from the bustling downtown core. Centre Island is often considered the jewel of the bunch, with public picnic sites, Centreville amusement park (including a petting zoo) and the massive Lake Ontario Pedestrian Pier. However, while Centre Island ferries only travel in the summer months, Ward's Island ferries sail year-round to service the residents of that island. Visiting Ward's Island in the spring and fall is my preferred way to visit the lake while avoiding the crowds that throng Centre Island in the summer. You can also visit Hanlan's Point in the summer for this effect, with the added bonus of the option of visiting the clothing optional beach. You can reach the ferry to the islands by walking south from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or by taking the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [High Park](http://www.highparktoronto.com)

The only park in Toronto that I've visited that you can get in deep enough to lose sight of the city. High Park is a massive green space to the west of the city. In addition to the wilder woods of the off-leash dog park, you can enjoy their more cultivated gardens as well as the ever popular spring cherry blossoms. The park also includes numerous sports fields, picnic areas and a mini zoo (with free admission). The park can be reached from the Line 2 High Park station, or by the 506 Carlton or 508 Lakeshore streetcar lines.

### [Ontario Science Centre](https://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca)

Located north of the city centre, the Science Centre offers everyone an opportunity to get hands on with science. Despite my feelings being biased by the frankly horrifying human body exhibit I was forced to witness as a child, I still find myself able to enjoy the virtual koi pond, the kinetic experiment room, and the rainforest exhibit. The Science Centre had virtual reality eagle flight before it was trendy and also boasts a full sized IMAX theatre. The Science Centre can be reached by taking the Line 1 subway to Eglinton station, followed by a bus, or by taking the Line 2 subway to Pape Station, also followed by a bus.

### [Scarborough Bluffs](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/scarborough-bluffs/)

Travel far enough east and stick to the lake and you'll encounter the towering Scarborough Bluffs. Majestic in their slow motion crumble, the parks around their base are popular with adventurers and wedding photographers alike. In addition to the surrounding trails, you can find the Rosetta McClain gardens at the top of the bluffs and a restaurant at their base. You can reach the bluffs by taking the Line 2 subway to either Warden or Kennedy Station, followed by a bus.
