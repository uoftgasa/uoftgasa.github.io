# The Comprehensive Guide to Graduate School

## Introduction

Welcome to graduate school at UofT's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics! We (the current graduate students) have written this guide to try and help you through all of the administrative details so you can get straight to your research. If you like, you can skip ahead to our suggested [to-do list](#new-student-to-do-list) for new students, or use the table of contents on the left to navigate to the appropriate section (note that the table of contents is not currently available on small screens).

This is a living document, you can contribute to its creation by forking the [uoftgasa](https://github.com/uoftgasa/uoftgasa.github.io) repository.

## Units

The Astronomy and Astrophysics community at UofT is composed of several units: the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Dunlap Institute, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and the Centre for Planetary Sciences. The relationships between these bodies can be a bit complex, but each unit is a part of the overall fabric of the department.

### Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
[Website](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca)

All astronomy graduate students at UofT are officially affiliated with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics (DAA), primarily spread across two buildings, the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building) and the 12th, 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower). 

### Dunlap Institute

[Website](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca)

The Dunlap Institute (Dunlap) is primarily focused on advancing instrumentation-based research and improving scientific outreach. Dunlap members (professors and post-docs) are located in the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building). Graduate students can become affiliated with the Dunlap if they are supervised by a Dunlap professor. These students can apply for additional funding not available to the rest of their cohort and are invited to Dunlap specific events like holiday parties and the 3 day Dunlap Retreat.

### Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics

[Website](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca)

The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) focuses on theoretical work CITA is located on the 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower).

### Centre for Planetary Sciences

### [The Royal Ontario Museum](https://www.rom.on.ca/en)
Canada's largest museum is a marvel inside and out - the interesting architechtural choices made for this building are best experienced in person. The special exhibitions bring extra variety to the usual displays on the museum's four floors. The geology exhibit is a close favourite of mine, but locals will have fond memories of the bat cave, and the new dinosaur exhibit can't help but impress. If you want to take a look, visit on a Tuesday with your student card for free entry. The museum is easily accessible from the Line 1 subway Museum Station.

### [The Art Gallery of Ontario](https://ago.ca)

This art gallery is another architechtural marvel, and is embedded in a neighbourhood of other smaller galleries and art stores. Arrive after 6pm on a Wednesday for free admission (not 

### [The Don Valley Park](https://donrivervalleypark.ca/park-map/)
If big city living has you hungry for greenery, look no farther than the Don River Valley Park. While Don Valley in casual conversation almost exclusively refers to the major highway that runs along the valley, the park is surprisingly tranquil. There is an extensive trail system suitable for walking or cycling, and at the right time of year you can visit the river to see the salmon run. At the south end of the park you can visit [Riverdale Farm](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/zoos-farms/riverdalefarm/), a working farm hosting beautiful gardens, historic buildings, and a pig and poultry barn. In the north you can find the [Evergreen Brick Works](https://www.evergreen.ca/evergreen-brick-works/), a former brick making factory that now hosts a variety of events to encourage sustainability, including regular markets, swap meets and art exhibitions. The Evergreen Brick Works runs a shuttle from the Line 2 subway Broadway Station, but one can also walk down into the valley from the Line 2 subway Castle Frank Station.


### [The PATH](http://torontopath.com/path-map/)

The ultimate test of your navigational abilities, the PATH will take only the hardiest souls to their intended destinations. Much of Toronto's business district is connected by underground tunnels filled with shops, food courts, and desperately turned around tourists. Hop off the Line 1 subway at any station south of Queen St and follow the signs for the PATH to start exploring.

### [The Eaton Centre](https://www.cfshops.com/toronto-eaton-centre.html)

Sitting between the Times Square wannabe of Yonge and Dundas Square to the North and Nathan Phillips Square to the South, this mall is equipped to help you shop until well after your standard dropping point with four floors of retail, and two food courts. If you feel the need to step outside, there are good odds that either of the bounding squares are hosting an event; if nothing else the strange alien spaceship of Toronto's new City Hall is worth a look. Nearer to the mall you can also find the [Toronto Public Labyrinth](http://www.labyrinthnetwork.ca/toronto-public-labyrinth/). You can easily reach the mall by taking the Line 1 subway to to Queen or Dundas stations.

### [Roundhouse Park and CN Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/3oZbcarwnRr)

If you've seen one Toronto sizzle reel, this area was probably heavily featured. Surrounded by glass walled condos, the Roundhouse Park is easy walking distance from the [SkyDome](https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/tickets) (now often known by the inferior moniker *The Rogers Centre*), the [Air Canada Centre](https://www.aircanadacentre.com) (go Raptors!),  [Ripley's Aquarium](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com), [Steamwhistle Breweries](https://steamwhistle.ca), and of course, the [CN Tower](http://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/home.html) (it's 553 m tall, if you read the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)). This area is a short walk from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or from the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [The Harbourfront Centre](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com)

Just steps to the south of the Roundhouse park awaits a smorgasbord of free artistic offerings spread along Toronto's waterfront. Two free art galleries, a winter skating rink and summer artisan markets make this area worth a visit at any time of the year. It's easily reachable by foot from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or more directly by the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [Toronto Islands](http://www.torontoisland.com)

The islands are a surprising escape from the city only a 15 minute ferry ride away from the bustling downtown core. Centre Island is often considered the jewel of the bunch, with public picnic sights, Centreville amusement park (including a petting zoo) and the massive Lake Ontario Pedestrian Pier. However, Centre Island ferries only travel in the summer months, but Ward's Island ferries sail year-round to service the residents of the island. Visiting Ward's Island in the spring and fall is my preferred way to visit the lake while avoiding the crowds that throng Centre Island in the summer. You can also visit Hanlan's Point in the summer for this effect, with the added bonus of the option of visiting the clothing optional beach. You can reach the ferry to the islands by walking south from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or by taking the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [High Park](http://www.highparktoronto.com)

The only park in Toronto that I've visited that you can get in deep enough to lose sight of the city. High Park is a massive green space to the west of the city. In addition to the wilder woods of the off-leash dog park, you can enjoy more cultivated gardens as well as the ever popular spring cherry blossoms. The park also includes numerous sports fields, picnic areas and mini zoo (with free admission). The park can be reached from the Line 2 High Park station, or by the 506 Carlton or 508 Lakeshore streetcar lines.
